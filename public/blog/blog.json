            ["a", "http://mlbgraphs.herokuapp.com/#/", "Link to Deployment"],
            ["p", "I have made a few bubble charts using D3 before, but this was the first one I created using an unknown dataset, and it also included by far the biggest set of data. For these reasons, I knew I needed to be a little smarter in writing the code, and make every aspect of the code as dynamic as possible – and not relying on hard coding."],
            ["p", "The first step in working on the graphic was simply deciding what I wanted the user experience to be. What should be shown and what controls should the user have? I decided that it made the most sense to only display one statistic at a time, and show one bubble for each year of data. While it was reasonable to cram in more data in the scatter plot, I felt that trying to display that much data in a bubble chart would just be an overload and make the chart unreadable. I wanted to display one stat at a time, and probably have some controls for the user to switch between different stats. I also knew that I’d want the bubbles to be color coded so multiple players could be viewed at the same time. The last thing I really wanted was for the size of the bubbles to be proportionate to that player’s performance, meaning that a bubble representing a 50 home run season should be bigger than a bubble representing a 10 home run season."],
            ["p", "Upon first jumping into the code, I had the luxury of already knowing exactly what the incoming data structures would look like since at this point I had already completed the back-end data scraping algorithm and the D3 scatter plot. The data came back as an array of objects, each with a player name, position, birth year, and array of arrays of yearly data, which were each objects themselves with properties for each stat and a property for the year. I decided that it would make sense to modify how the data was structured a bit, to make it easier to work with for this particular chart. Since I wanted each bubble to represent one stat, one year and one player, I felt that converting the data into one giant array would make sense, with each element in the array consisting of an object with a player name property, the name of the statistic, and the value of the statistic. I re-formatted the data this way using the below function:"],

            ["a", "https://github.com/louisrowan/fullstackReact/blob/master/app/components/D3Bubble.js", "D3 Bubble Code"],
            ["p", "The next problem I had to solve was that of the scales. D3 has a linear scale function that takes in a domain of data and returns a value that could be used for each bubble’s radius in the specified range. I have used this successfully in the past, but knew I would have to be smarter about how to use it this time. If I put all data into this function it would not produce a meaningful scale, as elements with a stat like hits or RBI (which could have a value over 100) would all be large bubbles, while any average-based stat like OBP (which have a below between 0 and 1) would produce a bubble at the very bottom of the specified range. This meant that I would need to create not one linear scale, but a different scale for each stat. This would allow a much better visual affect, as bubbles would not be scaled based on their relation to ALL other data points, but only the data points of that same stat."],
            ["p", "My solution to create all these scales was to loop through all possible stats (the list was passed down via props), and create a scale for that stat. I used the d3 min and d3 max functions, and a simple conditional to identify the min and max for each unique statistic, and create a scale using the min and max as the domain, and a range of 20 and 50 (which would produce bubbles with radius of 20-50 px for each stat). I then saved each scale as a property onto a ‘scales’ object, with the name being the statistic the scale represented."],
            ["p", "At this point I had the data formatted the way I wanted and a scale for each statistic, so I was ready to write the code for the actual data points. I brought in the data, stat list, and scales object as parameters of this data rendering function. This code was simple D3, binding the data to elements, adding circles, and giving it some basic styling. The only tricky part here was using the scales I had just created. To do this, when giving each circle its radius property I passed its ‘num’ property into the appropriate scale from the scales object, as seen here: "],
            ["img", "./blog/mlb/img4.JPG"],
            ["p", "After adding a tooltip which was dynamically modified on circle mouseover events, the last thing I needed to do was to setup the actual force part of the force layout. The affect I wanted was for a user to be able to click a button to bring the appropriate stat’s bubbles onto the screen, but I wanted to code this in a dynamic way and not just hard-code a different force function for each stat. I accomplished this by simply wrapping a d3.forceX function inside another function, which took a stat name as a parameter. Inside the forceX function I then returned width/2 (which pushes elements to the center of the screen) if the element’s statistic was equal to the inputted stat, or -2*width (which pushes it off the screen) for a different stat. I kept the Y force at a simple height/2 no matter the stat, and added a forceCollide function to keep the bubbles from running into each other, where I again passed the ‘num’ property of each element into the appropriate linear scale. The last step here was to create buttons for each stat, binded to event listeners. When the button is clicked, call the custom forceX function, passing in the ID of the button (which were given the same name as the corresponding stat) as the parameter of the custom forceX function. This meant that if a user clicks ‘HR’, then ‘HR’ would be passed in to the custom force function, and any stat with the stat attribute of ‘HR’ would be pushed towards the center of the SVG, while stats of a different type are pushed off the screen. The code is shown here: "],
            ["img", "./blog/mlb/img5.JPG"],
            ["p", "The benefit of writing the code with dynamic scales and forces is that I could update the available statistics data set and not have to touch any of the scale or force code, as it is currently written in a way to account for any stat since none of the scale functionality is hard-coded in. This was definitely a big eye-opener for me, as much (ok, all) of my previous D3 code was overly specific to the specific data set, and any modifications to the data would require new code to be written to account for the change."],
            ["h3", "Using Promises to handle response of parsed data"],
            ["p", "When I first began experimenting with sending back data that I had scraped from the web, I ran into some issues as express kept sending an undefined value to my front-end. I printed out the result of my parsing algorithm and was sure that I was producing an object, yet this object somehow wasn’t being properly sent with res.send(). After finding that hard-coding a value to send back worked, I realized that the issue was that I was not doing anything to handle the asynchronous nature of my code. What was happening was that res.send() was firing before the function whose return value it was supposed to be passing along had finished evaluating. This was because the function was using the request.js library to make HTTP requests, and this asynchronous action was resulting in res.send() firing while the value of my parsing function had yet to be defined."],
            ["p", "I decided that this was as good a time as any to finally integrate the idea of promises into my code, to control when my back-end was sending its response to the front-end. To do this, I ended up using 2 promises to really take control of handling the timing of multiple async actions. The first was written into the controller, I passed my parsing algorithm into the ‘resolve’ argument of the promise, which would trigger the ‘resolve’ event only when it was completed. On completion the code written in the following ‘.then’ function would run, which is where I wrote in the response back to the front-end, passing in the return value that the promise gave me. The end result of this promise was that I had guaranteed that I would not be sending a response back to the front-end until my parsing algorithm had resolved."],
            ["img", "./blog/mlb/img1.JPG"],
            ["a", "https://github.com/louisrowan/fullstackReact/blob/master/server/api.js", "Controller Code"],
            ["p", "I also used a promise within the parsing algorithm itself as well, as I realized that this function itself had a problem of returning a value before all the asynchronous actions had completed. To do this, I put all of the parsing steps, including the HTTP request from request.js inside the promise. I used the ‘resolve’ argument to pass along my finished data from the parsing."],

            ["a", "https://github.com/louisrowan/fullstackReact/blob/master/server/parse.js", "Parsing Code"],
            ["p", "* I then called this promise, passing in an argument with the string to be parsed. Upon getting back a response from this promise, I returned that value, and the promise itself was also returned, which meant that this response data was passed all the way to the response value of the first promise I wrote in the controller, which was then sent to the front-end."],
            ["p", "The benefit I found from using promises was how easy it made my code to reason about. While not the only solution to handling async events in JavaScript, promises make the flow control very easy to follow. Anybody who understands how promises work would be able to make sense of my code, and understand quickly where the async actions are occurring (inside the promise), and what events need to fire after those async actions are completed (the code in the ‘.then’). Promises also make it very easy to handle multiple async requests, as I did later when I used Promise.all to chain together multiple promises that all needed to be resolved at the same time."],
            ["h3", "React Architecture"],
            ["p", "When developing a website using the React library, I tend to both store a lot of data in state, as well as pass down many functions with props. I find that this type of architecture makes my code easiest to both reason about and modify. On this particular site, I had a few concerns to think about. The first was how/where to store player data, which came from the back-end ajax requests. When I got that data, where should I store it, how can I transfer it to the D3 charts, and how long should it persist? Another concern was how to handle all the logic on the landing-page form, such as when to show error messages, how to show the user when an ajax request is being made, when to make the buttons to view the charts enabled, etc."],
            ["p", "While certain pieces of state are very specific to certain components, such as when the charts are ready to be viewed or what a form error message should be, I often find it more sensible to store that data all the way up the chain on the layout container level. This is because this information is not completely independent, it relies on other factors such as the state of an ajax request, the number of players currently on a user’s list, etc. These other factors are often handled at a container level because they might be triggered in multiple ways from different functions, and the result of their state can affect the entire site. For instance, I decided it made sense to keep track of all player data on a user’s current list at my top-level component so that this data would persist no matter which page the user went to. Storing that data in top-level state and passing it down to different pages via props is a very easy way for that data to persist, so it makes sense to me to store the ajax requests to get that data and the data itself in my layout container."],
            ["p", "By putting my main ajax call for data in my layout, I do kind of force my hand regarding where to store other seemingly less important data, such as my chartReady boolean which dictates if buttons to view charts should be enabled. I decided that even if a user has a player on their player list I still did not want to make the charts viewable if another ajax call was being processed, thus I found it sensible to update that status of chartReady where I made that ajax call, both by setting it to ‘false’ when the call was made and then ‘true’ when the call resolved (And if there were >= 1 players on their list)."],
            ["p", "This kind of architecture does result in a very busy layout container and many props being passed down, but I think the benefit of storing all that data in the same place and handling so much logic in the same file has some major benefits, and can make debugging much quicker. I also think it would be easier for another developer to read code written like this, since they would not need to be constantly switching between files to follow how logic is handled. This also proved beneficial when handling parameters, which I talk through here next."],
            ["h3", "Handling Params"],
            ["p", "Another architectural decision I made was how to implement my feature for handling parameters. At first, a chart showing data could only be accessed by going to the landing page, adding players to the list, and then viewing the chart. I wanted to be able to save the ‘state’ of a chart so that someone could send a URL to somebody else and immediately access the same chart. To do this I decided to implement some optional parameters."],
            ["p", "React has a CopyToClipboard add-on that can copy whatever I desire to a user’s clipboard when they activate my click-handler, so my idea was to somehow create a list of parameters for each chart that would then be copied to the clipboard, and when pasted into a different window, would then be processed through some sort of logic to use those parameters to re-create the chart that they were copied from."],
            ["p", "Creating the parameters were pretty easy. First I used the native JavaScript window.location.origin method to get the current domain (this would allow the URL to work whether they were copied locally on a development server or on the production site), and added either ‘/bubble’ or ‘/scatter’ depending on which chart they were currently viewing. After adding a ‘?’, which indicates the start of parameters, I then looped through all the current players (via props), and for each player, added their name connected with dashes as the value, with the key being ‘p1’, ‘p2’ or ‘p3’, depending on their index in the players array. I also had to add the player’s ID to account for players with  non-unique names (like Ken Griffey), which hard-coded the URL search on the back-end, as opposed to searching with the usual method which used Promise.all to asynchronously search for multiple players with the same name in parallel and return all results."],
            ["img", "./blog/mlb/img6.JPG"],
            ["p", "To handle an HTTP request with parameters, I used the componentWillMount lifecycle method in my layout container. It checked to see if there were any parameters by using this.props.locaiton.query, and called my handleParams method if there were. In handleParams, I checked to see if there were any params named either ‘p1’, ‘p2’ or ‘p3’, and if there were, I parsed their values and called my getPlayerData ajax method to get the proper data for those players. This also goes back to my earlier point about keeping logic in the container, as it was super easy to make these ajax calls since the method was defined right in the same component."],
            ["p", "The last step was to use the componentDidUpdate lifecycle method in both the scatter and bubble chart components. This method fires whenever there is an update to the props, and the only possible update given how I structured the site would be if new player data came in from the parameters list. When this data comes in, I then call the appropriate method to trigger the D3 SVG rendering to display the data. It’s possible I could end up adding another feature to the site which would change the incoming props of one of these components but for a reason that would not dictate re-rending the D3 chart, in which case I would implement some sort of conditional in componentDidUpdate to determine if I wanted to re-start the D3 rendering or not."],

We can use regular CSS selectors, so the code on line 4 will select the first svg element on the page. We can also select by class or ID, such as (‘#id_here’) or (‘.classname_here’). There is another method d3.selectAll that does the same thing as select, only it returns an array of all matched items, not just the first item found. In this case I used d3.select because I know there will only be one svg element on the page."],

For instance with the d3.min function I am calling, I pass in the array of data, as well as a function that implicitly returns the population attribute for each piece of data. The min function then finds the minimum value, and it is saved to the rMin variable in this example."],
        ["h3", "d3.scaleLinear"],
        ["p", "The reason for finding the maximum and minimum values is to input them into a linear scale. The scale is helpful because it can normalize an array of data and produce values on a scale that works better. The scale is created using d3.scaleLinear(), although in version 3 of react the code should be d3.scale.linear(). We can supply a domain of the min and max values that we just calculated, and then a range that we wish those values to be distributed along. In this case, the populations that ranged from 13 to 39 will now spread from 20 to 50. This will make sense in just a moment when we are sizing the bubbles in the chart."],
        ["h3", "Data and Enter methods"],
        ["p", "The next block of code is selecting the svg (which we saved to the variable svg earlier), and from it, selecting everything with the class of ‘node’. Now, obviously at this point in the code there is nothing with the class of node. The way d3 works is that it can retroactively select items after they have been created, so while these elements with the class named node do not exist now, if we create them later, this selection will work."],
        ["p", "The next line calls the ‘.data’ method, which allows us to bind our data to these elements with the class node. In this case I saved the data to the variable data, so the code is ‘.data(data)’.  Then we call the ‘enter’ method. The enter method will create elements for each data point that does not have a corresponding element to bind to. In this case, none of the data points have an element to bind to (we selected items with a class name of node, of which there are none), so the enter method will bind all 5 data points to new elements. These elements do not have a tag, so we call ‘.append(‘g’)’ which will add ‘g’ (for group) tags to each data point. The last line of code is to give these g elements the class of node."],

        ["p", "Another way to think of this code is that some of it is being run though twice. On the first run-through, there are no elements with the class of node, so the data doesn’t have anything to bind to.

Instead of just passing in the population for each node to be its radius, we can pass in the linear scale function (saved as circleScale) with the population as the argument.

On like 36 I call the ‘.force’ method, which takes 2 parameters, a name and a force. The name can be whatever we want, and I call it ‘x’ here. Then we pass in the force being applied. The first force we need is a horizontal force, that will push our circles where we want on the X axis. D3-force has a function for this, d3.forceX. Here I will pass in (width/2), which is half of the previously defined svg width from line 2. This will push all the circles toward that point in the svg. We also apply a ‘strength’ function to the force, to tell d3 how much power should be behind this force. A higher strength number would overpower other weaker forces. I do the same thing on line 37, only with the d3.forceY function and pass in (height/2). I also made sure to use the same strength as I did with the X force, or else one of the forces would overpower the other."],

In this case, we just need to pass in the radius of each circle, which again was the population put through the circleScale function. We also could add some additional padding if we wanted, which would have looked like: ‘d3.forceCollide((d) => circleScale(d.population) + 10)’."],

But the chart itself is a bit boring as nothing moves, so let’s change that! The d3-force layout does not just execute at runtime and then stop, it is continuously operating as long as the chart is showing. This means that we can modify the forces, which will move our bubbles around. Recall that earlier I hard-coded the ‘x’ and ‘y’ forces to push everything towards the middle of the SVG. A better pattern would be to extrapolate those methods and save them as variables, that could be used later. I’ve shown this below:"],
        ["img","./blog/d3bubble/d314.JPG"],
        ["img","./blog/d3bubble/d315.JPG"],
        ["p","One thing to note here is that we must define the forces before they are called, so I made sure to define the forceXNormal and forceYNormal variables on earlier lines than they are first called."],
        ["p","The next step is to create a few clickable buttons in the HTML with IDs, that when clicked will change the forces and move the bubbles around. I’ve added 4 buttons below:"],
        ["img","./blog/d3bubble/d316.JPG"],
        ["p","The first button I will cover is the ‘#split’ button. When someone clicks it, I want the bubbles to spread apart and head to the different corners of the svg. The code to accomplish this is below:"],
        ["img","./blog/d3bubble/d317.JPG"],
        ["p","With the earlier forceXNormal method, we returned width/2 for all data. Now with the forceXSplit method, the return value depends on the data itself. For datapoints with a population greater than 20 we return width/5, otherwise return 4*width/5. Likewise with the forceYSplit method, for names of states starting after ‘M’ we return height/5, otherwise return 4*height/5. I also kept the strength of these forces the same as before, 0.05."],
        ["img","./blog/d3bubble/d318.JPG"],
        ["p","Above is the code to handle the actual click of the ‘#split’ button. We can select the button itself using d3, and give it an on-click method. Inside the click handler, we simply select the force layout (we saved it to the variable simulation earlier), and then call the ‘.force’ method on both the ‘x’ and ‘y’ forces (we named them x and y earlier as well). We then apply the forces we just defined, giving ‘x’ the ‘forceXSplit’ method and ‘forceYSplit’ to ‘y’."],
        ["p","The next 2 lines of code are needed to ‘jump-start’ the force layout. The way force works is that it slowly dies down over time. Meaning if someone let the page sit for a while and then clicked our button, the bubbles would not move because the force would be dead. Setting the alpha target and calling restart on the force gives it a kick that is needed to ‘wake up’ the force. Let’s check out the new behavior:"],
        ["img","./blog/d3bubble/d3gif2.gif"],
        ["p","Wow! That only makes our chart about 1000x better. Notice where the bubbles have moved, Texas and California were the 2 states with populations over 20 so they moved to (width/5), while the rest moved to (4*width/5). And for the Y coordinates, Texas and New York are the states with names starting after M, so they both moved to (height/5) while the others moved to (4*height/5). Florida and Illinois both have names starting before M and populations under 20, so they moved to the same spot."],
        ["p","Let’s also active the ‘#normal’ button so that our bubbles can return to the starting position. This is only too easy as we already defined the forces that we need, forceXNormal and forceYNormal, and is why I wanted to pull those pieces of code out and save them as variables."],
        ["img","./blog/d3bubble/d319.JPG"],
        ["p","And the new behavior:"],
        ["img","./blog/d3bubble/d3gif3.gif"],
        ["p","The next behavior I wanted to implement was a way to sort the bubbles in order. Now there are many ways for this to be done, and I decided to try one that required a few different forces working together. To produce the ‘X’ coordinate I needed to find a way to give each bubble an ascending value, but how? My solution was to create another linear scale, like we did for the radius. Only this time, instead of a range of 20-50, I wanted a range that would produce good X coordinate values, so I made the minimum 100 and the maximum (width – 100):"],
        ["img","./blog/d3bubble/d320.JPG"],
        ["p","I then created the forceXSort method:"],
        ["img","./blog/d3bubble/d321.JPG"],
        ["p","This method uses the sortScale method I just created, and returns the corresponding value as the X coordinate. Since the min and max were 100 and width-100, the bubbles will all be given an X coordinate between those 2 values, and in the correct order. Now for the click handler:"],
        ["img","./blog/d3bubble/d322.JPG"],
        ["p","And the behavior"],
        ["img","./blog/d3bubble/d3gif4.gif"],
        ["p","Hmm… this code kind of works, but there are a couple bugs. The first obvious one is that the ‘y’ force gets messed up at the end. This is because we modified the Y force with the split click earlier, and never returned the Y force to being height/2. The other bug is that the bubbles are somewhat awkwardly spread out even when they are all on the same X axis. California’s population is so much greater than everyone else’s that its value from the sortScale method pushes it far off to the side. Now, this might be the desired behavior in some cases, but I would rather that the bubbles end up touching."],
        ["p","One way to fix this would be to call another group of forces after the bubbles have settled in the correct order, to push them into their final positions. This could be accomplished simply by using a setTimeout function inside the ‘#sort’ click handler, like so:"],
        ["img","./blog/d3bubble/d323.JPG"],
        ["p","I chose not to add the ‘.alphaTarget’ and ‘restart’ methods inside the setTimeout function because these forces would have just been called 3 seconds ago, and thus would not be needed to kick-start the force. My thought process here would be that we need to call forceYNormal to align all bubbles back to height/2, and calling forceXNormal will squish the bubbles together horizontally so that they touch. Here is the new behavior:"],
        ["img","./blog/d3bubble/d3gif5.gif"],
        ["p","Wow… that didn’t work at all! Calling forceXNormal inside the setTimeout completely overwrote the forceX sort method, and we ended up with the exact same behavior as when we click the ‘#normal’ button. So the solution? Creating a new forceX that is much weaker than the one we just called. We are calling forceYNormal with the strength of 0.05, so we need a new forceX that will be overpowered by that. It took some trial and error but I ended up with this:"],
        ["img","./blog/d3bubble/d324.JPG"],
        ["img","./blog/d3bubble/d325.JPG"],
        ["p", "And the behavior:"],
        ["img","./blog/d3bubble/d3gif6.gif"],
        ["p","Notice how the two different stages of forces work together. The first brings the bubbles into the correct order on the X axis, then after 3 seconds, the new forces bring them all to the same height on the X axis, and very gently pushes them towards the center of the svg. forceXWeak is just strong enough to move a bubble when it is not touching anything, but too weak to push past another circle on its way towards the center. I also added a reverse method:"],

        ["img","./blog/d3bubble/d327.JPG"],
        ["p", "The reverseSort method is the exact same as sort, only it returns (width-position) instead of just position. This means that the larger populations will end up on the left side. And now the behavior of all the buttons:"],

Using transitions for these changes would be much more challenging than a typical CSS transition, and would require some pretty complex code in the React lifecycle methods for each component to properly add and remove the appropriate classes at the correct time.

The first step is to install the add-on using npm, with the command ‘npm i –save react-addons-css-transition-group’. Next we will require it in the appropriate component. Now, the component we are looking to animate is ListItem, however we do NOT want to use the ReactCSSTransitionGroup on that element. This is because the ReactCSSTransitionGroup must already be mounted on the DOM for it to trigger the enter animation, and must remain on the DOM after an element is removed to trigger the removal animation. For these reasons, we are going to require it in the List component, even though we are not animating the List."],

In other words, do NOT use the index, since if an item with index of 2 is removed, on the next render there could still be an item with an index of 2. This would confuse the ReactCSSTransitionGroup addon, so an easy fix is to make the key something completely unique, as I have done here by using the name property of each object. In practice this still is not a perfect key since we could theoretically want multiple people with the same name in our list, but for simplicity it is unique enough for this example."],

        ["p", "So what is happening here? Is hoisting going on or not? Well, nothing in the code is being ‘moved’ anywhere else. What the JavaScript engine is really doing is running through the code multiple times. The first time is the compiling phase, where it is looking for any variable for function declarations. With a variable declaration, all that the engine cares about is the declaration, not the initialization. This is why, in example 2, we received ‘undefined’ as the value for banana. JavaScript was aware that we declared a banana variable, as evidenced by the fact that we did not get a reference error, however clearly the compiling phase did not check to see what we wanted to set banana equal to. When we ran console.log(banana), JavaScript did not know the value of banana because we haven’t set that yet in the code, and it does not look at it during the compiling phase."],
